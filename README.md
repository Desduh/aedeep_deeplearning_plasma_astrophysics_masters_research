# AEDeep+: Anomaly Detection with Deep Learning in Plasma Physics and Astrophysical Systems — from Space Weather to Multimessenger Astronomy

## Project Overview

This repository contains the research, models, experiments, and results developed as part of the master's project **AEDeep+ (Anomaly Explorer with Deep Learning)** at the **National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Brazil**.

The project focuses on the development and application of deep learning techniques — particularly **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Autoencoders** — for the **detection and prediction of anomalies** in complex spatial and temporal datasets. It aims to address scientific challenges in **plasma physics**, **solar activity**, **space weather**, **galaxy classification**, and **multimessenger astronomy**.

## Objectives

- Design and implement the AEDeep framework using LSTM-based forecasting and LSTM Autoencoders for unsupervised anomaly detection.
- Integrate the **p-model-based multidimensional anomaly simulator** for testing and validating models on synthetic data.
- Apply AEDeep+ in various scientific domains:

  - **Solar Physics**: Forecasting disruptive events using real observational data (e.g., SDO/AIA) and tokamak simulations (e.g., JOREK).
  - **Space Weather**: Detecting anomalous patterns in geospatial time series, with potential deployment in **CubeSats**.
  - **Astrophysics and Cosmology**: Morphological classification of galaxies with unusual shapes or behaviors using **LSST** data.
  - **Multimessenger Astronomy**: Early detection of transient events such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), neutron star mergers, and unconventional signatures.
