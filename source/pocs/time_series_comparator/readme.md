# 📊 Comparing Synthetic P-model Data with Real Tokamak Data

**Author:** Carlos Eduardo Falandes

This project aims to compare time series from real Tokamak data with synthetic data generated by the **P-model**. The goal is to verify if the synthetic data share similar statistical and dynamical properties to the real data, so that models trained on synthetic data can generalize well to real Tokamak signals.

## 🧠 Motivation

Real Tokamak data are limited, so synthetic data from the P-model can help train machine learning models. However, verifying similarity between these datasets is essential to avoid misleading model training.

## ✅ Analysis Steps

1. 📈 **Visual Comparison**  
Overlay and inspect both time series to observe similarities in trends and variability.

2. 🧮 **Statistical Features**  
| Metric          | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Mean**        | Central tendency of data. |
| **Standard Deviation** | Measure of variability. |
| **Skewness**    | Asymmetry of the distribution. |
| **Kurtosis**    | Peakedness or flatness of the distribution. |
| **Min / Max**   | Range of values. |

3. 📊 **Value Distribution**  
Histogram or KDE plots to compare the empirical distributions.

4. 🎵 **Frequency Analysis (FFT)**  
Compare the power spectra to detect shared dominant frequencies.

5. 🔁 **Autocorrelation (ACF)**  
Compare temporal dependencies and cyclic patterns.

6. 🧩 **Complexity & Entropy**  
Use metrics like Sample Entropy to evaluate signal unpredictability.

7. 📉 **Dimensionality Reduction**  
Techniques like PCA, t-SNE, or UMAP visualize similarity in latent space.
